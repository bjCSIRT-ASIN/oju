== Overview

System Administration provides centralized management of Cerberus core settings and email configurations. This section covers system-wide parameters that affect monitoring behavior, network connectivity, and notification capabilities.

== System Configuration

=== General Settings

**Core System Parameters:**

* **Email** - Primary system email address for notifications
* **Proxies** - List of proxy servers for HTTP requests (Route monitoring traffic through specified proxies, e.g., http://proxy1:8080, http://proxy2:8080)
* **Proxy usage** - Controls whether monitoring uses configured proxy servers. Toggle action automatically tests proxy connectivity when enabled
* **DNS servers** - List of DNS servers for domain resolution.Custom DNS servers for domain lookups and validation
* **User-Agent** - HTTP User-Agent string for web requests. Identifies Cerberus in HTTP requests to monitored platforms
* **Max worker** - Maximum number of concurrent scanning workers. Controls system resource usage and scanning parallelism
* **Scan frequency** - Interval between monitoring scans. Controls how often platforms are monitored
* **Use host on proxy failure** - Determines fallback behavior when proxy connections fail. When enabled, falls back to direct connection if proxy unavailable
* **Receive alerts** - Global alert reception toggle. Enable/disable system-wide alert generation

=== Configuration Management

**Updating Settings:**

1. Navigate to **Config > General Settings**
2. Modify desired parameters
3. System validates input format and values
4. Changes are applied immediately with system logging
5. Cache invalidation occurs for DNS settings

== Email Configuration

=== SMTP Settings

**Server Configuration:**

* **SMTP server** - SMTP server hostname or IP address
* **SMTP port:** - SMTP server port number
* **Use TLS:** - Enable STARTTLS encryption for SMTP connection
* **Use SSL:** - Enable SSL/TLS encryption from connection start
* **Email host:** - Username for SMTP authentication
* **Email password:** - Password for SMTP authentication
* **Default sender name:** - Display name for outgoing emails
* **Default reply-to email:** - Display reply-to email
* **Configuration active:** - Master switch for email functionality. This enable/disable all email notifications

[NOTE]
====
TLS and SSL are mutually exclusive. Configure only one encryption method based on your SMTP server requirements.
====

=== Email Configuration Management

**Connection Testing:**

* Automatic SMTP connection test when saving configuration
* Validates server connectivity, authentication, and security settings
* Configuration is rejected if connection test fails
* Test includes DNS resolution, port connectivity, and authentication

**Toggle Status:**

* Email system can be enabled/disabled without changing configuration
* Enabling inactive configuration triggers automatic connection test
* System prevents activation if connection test fails
* Status changes are logged for audit purposes

**Rate Limiting:**

* Email configuration updates limited to 2 attempts per 60 seconds
* Prevents excessive server testing and potential account lockouts
* Limit applies to configuration updates, not toggle operations
* Rate limit reset after timeout period

[IMPORTANT]
====
Email configuration changes trigger immediate connection testing. Ensure SMTP credentials and server settings are correct to avoid account lockouts.
====

=== Configuration Process

**Setting Up Email:**

1. Navigate to **Config > Email Settings**
2. Enter SMTP server details (hostname, port)
3. Select appropriate encryption method (TLS or SSL)
4. Provide authentication credentials
5. Set sender name for outgoing emails
6. Save configuration
7. Activate email system using toggle if test successful

System Administration provides essential control over Cerberus monitoring behavior and notification capabilities, ensuring optimal performance and reliable alert delivery.
