== Ticket Creation Process

=== Automatic Ticket Generation

**Trigger Events:**

* **Priority** - Based on alert severity and type
* **Status** - Initial status set to "new"

== Troubleshooting

=== Common Issues

**Connection Problems:**

* **Server Unreachable** - Verify RTIR URL accessibility
* **Authentication Failed** - Check username/password accuracy
* **Network Issues** - Confirm firewall and proxy settings
* **SSL Certificate** - Validate RTIR server certificate

**Ticket Creation Failures:**

* **Missing Focal Points** - Ensure entity has active contacts
* **Invalid Queue** - Verify RTIR queue configuration
* **Permission Issues** - Check RTIR user permissions
* **Data Validation** - Review ticket content formatting



RTIR integration ensures seamless incident response coordination by automatically creating detailed tickets and notifying appropriate stakeholders, enabling rapid response to security incidents across monitored organizations.

[IMPORTANT]

While the tool can create tickets in RTIR and resolve alerts on its own dashboard when issues are addressed, it does not automatically resolve tickets within RTIR itself. For troubleshooting ticket creation or other integration issues, detailed logs are available in the workers container.
